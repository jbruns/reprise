//! Checks of Managed Folders: what is in a folder now against the store's record of what Builds put there. A check
//! only reads the folder, through the handle it was opened by and without following a symlink; what it finds is
//! written to the store alone. A built file is read only when its size or modification time differ from its record,
//! and every entry Title Select did not build is classified as Drift, read once and then only when it changes.
