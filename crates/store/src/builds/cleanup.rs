//! Carrying out an approved cleanup in its Managed Folder, as a Build. Each action is one you chose for one entry,
//! kept file or built file, and acts only on what the plan found: an entry is moved only while it is, by `lstat`
//! through the folder's handle, the identity, size, modification and status change times the plan's check read,
//! and is recorded only once what is at its new name is that identity again.
//!
//! The threat model: the Host keeps a Managed Folder mode 2750, so only the service's own user can create, rename
//! or remove entries in it, and the folders Title Select creates inside it are private to that user. A process
//! running as that user is out of scope (it can rewrite the store). What another user, or something left over from
//! before, could have put at a name is never acted on: a cleanup moves an entry only by one rename that never
//! replaces anything, checks it by identity before and after, records the move as an intent first, and makes both
//! folders durable before recording it done. A stop at any point leaves the intent, which recovery settles only
//! forward, from where the entry is found by identity: moved, still where it was, or neither, which is reported and
//! never lost track of in the store. Nothing is deleted, and no folder is removed by name: what is kept aside, and
//! the file as it was before a repack, are kept files.
