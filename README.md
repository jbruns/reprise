# Title Select

Audits ROM collections against DAT files, and records exactly what was verified and against which DAT revision.

Status: early pilot. You get a headless audit command; a store of DAT revisions, source sets and audits; the Service,
a JSON API that runs audits as durable jobs; and a headless selection command. Selection jobs, change plans and more
of the workbench follow.
The words used here are defined in [GLOSSARY.md](GLOSSARY.md).

## Audit

```sh
title-select audit --dat <DAT file> <source set directory> [--output <report file>]
```

This audit is stateless: it needs no store or configuration. `audit --set` (below) audits a registered source set
and records the audit in the store; its report has the same shape.

Audits every file under the source set directory against a Logiqx XML DAT (for example a No-Intro DAT) and
writes a JSON report to stdout, or to `--output`. It only reads: your source set is never changed.

- Every payload is read and checksummed (size, CRC32, MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256). Each member of a `.zip` archive is
  an entry; any other file, including other archive formats, is one entry. Nested archives are not opened.
- A finding is decided by payload before name: a file whose name is wrong but whose payload matches a ROM is
  misnamed, not unmatched. A payload matches a ROM when every checksum the DAT supplies for it agrees.
- An unreadable file, directory, archive or member becomes an unreadable entry and the audit continues.
  Symbolic links are followed.
- Exits 0 when the audit completes, whatever it found. Exits non-zero with a message on stderr when the DAT
  cannot be read or the source set directory does not exist.

### Report

```jsonc
{
  "schema": 2,                       // version of this report's shape
  "dat_revision": {                  // the DAT revision the audit is pinned to
    "sha256": "254e…",               // SHA-256 of the unmodified DAT file: its identity
    "name": "Atari - Atari 2600",    // from the DAT header
    "version": "20261027-195049",
    "file": "Atari - Atari 2600 (20261027-195049).dat"
  },
  "source_set": "/path/to/set",
  "started_at": "2026-10-28T22:45:46.539Z",
  "finished_at": "2026-10-28T22:45:46.942Z",
  "summary": {
    "findings": { "matched": 786, "misnamed": 19, "conflicting": 3, "mismatched": 0, "unmatched": 41, "unreadable": 0 },
    "games": { "complete": 802, "incomplete": 0, "missing": 70 }
  },
  "entries": [
    {
      "path": "Breakout (Europe).zip",           // relative to the source set
      "member": "Breakout (Europe).a26",         // present for a ZIP member
      "finding": "conflicting",
      "roms": [{ "game": "Breakout (Europe) (Rev 1)", "name": "Breakout (Europe) (Rev 1).a26" }],
      "named_rom": { "game": "Breakout (Europe)", "name": "Breakout (Europe).a26" },
      "evidence": { "level": "payload", "algorithms": ["size", "crc32", "md5", "sha1", "sha256"] }
    }
  ],
  "games": [
    { "name": "Breakout (Europe)", "status": "missing", "missing_roms": ["Breakout (Europe).a26"] }
  ]
}
```

- `finding` is one of `matched`, `misnamed`, `conflicting`, `mismatched`, `unmatched` or `unreadable` (see the
  glossary).
- `roms` lists the ROMs the entry counts towards. For a matched entry that is every ROM with its name and payload,
  so an identical ROM shared by several games counts for each. For a misnamed or conflicting entry it is every
  ROM the payload matches, so the entry completes the game its payload belongs to.
- `named_rom` is the ROM the entry's name gives, present when it differs from the payload's (conflicting, mismatched).
- `evidence.algorithms` lists what the finding rests on. For a payload match, it is size plus each checksum that
  every ROM in `roms` supplies; all of them were compared and agreed. A mismatched or unmatched entry has only size and
  CRC32, the lookup that found no matching ROM. An unreadable entry has no evidence and a `reason` instead.
- A game is `complete`, `incomplete` or `missing`; `missing_roms` lists its ROMs no entry's payload matched.

## Selection

```sh
title-select select --dat <DAT file> --profile <selection profile file> [--output <file>] [--timeout <seconds>]
```

Chooses releases from a DAT with your selection profile and prints the explained selection as JSON on stdout, or to
`--output`. The selection engine is pinned and runs as a subprocess: offline, on one CPU, in a scratch folder under
`<store>/tmp` (or the system's temp folder without a store) that is deleted afterwards, and stopped after `--timeout`
seconds (600 by default). The selection is derived from the engine's trace of every decision it made, never from the
DAT the engine writes. The engine install is `--retool`, else `TITLE_SELECT_RETOOL`, else `/opt/retool`; an install
built from other pins than this binary's is refused. `title-select --version` prints the pins, and the workbench's
About page says where the engine comes from.

Your selection profile is JSON; every field is optional, and an unknown field, region, language or video standard is
refused:

```jsonc
{
  "region_order": ["USA", "World", "Europe"],  // a region left out is filtered out; empty: the default order
  "language_order": ["En"],                    // empty: the languages implied by the region order
  "localization_order": [],                    // local names only: no effect on what is chosen
  "video_order": [],                           // empty: the default order
  "exclude": ["demos", "bad_dumps"],           // add_ons, aftermarket, applications, audio, bad_dumps, bios,
                                               // bonus_discs, coverdiscs, demos, educational, games, manuals, mia,
                                               // multimedia, pirate, preproduction, promotional, unlicensed, video
  "options": {
    "prefer_retroachievements": false, "prefer_oldest": false, "prefer_regions": false,
    "prefer_licensed": false, "prefer_modern_rips": false, "filter_languages": false,
    "disable_1g1r": false,
    "compilations": "default"                  // default, individual, keep or optimize
  },
  "overrides": { "exclude": ["/^Pong"], "include": ["|Pong (USA)"] },  // text, |full name, or /regex
  "post_filters": [],
  "systems": {                                 // keyed by the system name derived from the DAT header
    "Atari - Atari 2600 (No-Intro)": { "region_order": ["Europe", "USA"], "replace_post_filters": false }
  },
  "choices": {                                 // your choices, by system and then group: the releases you checked
    "Atari - Atari 2600 (No-Intro)": { "pong": ["Pong (Europe)"], "parachute": [] }
  }
}
```

A per-system order, `exclude` or `options` replaces the global one; its overrides are added to the global ones, and
its post filters too unless `replace_post_filters` is set.

In overrides and post filters, plain text matches part of a release's name, `|` the full name and `/` a regular
expression (Python syntax, ignoring case). A profile with a regular expression that doesn't compile is refused, so it
can't silently match nothing. Anything else the engine warns about on a run that succeeds goes to the server's log, or
to standard error for `title-select select`.

A choice replaces the selection's winners in one group with the releases you checked, zero or more, after the engine
has run. It is kept only where it differs from what the engine picks, or where you confirmed an unresolved group's
pick. A choice is not applied, and is flagged, when a checked release is now excluded by your settings (conflicting)
or gone from the group (stale); a choice for a group that is gone is kept and listed until you drop it. A choice that
the engine now makes anyway is flagged as matching the default, so you can drop it.

```jsonc
{
  "pins": {                          // what the selection was made with
    "retool_commit": "59f169f5…", "patch_set_sha256": "…", "clone_list_commit": "cdeb391e…", "trace_schema": 1
  },
  "dat_sha256": "254e…",             // the DAT revision
  "system": "Atari - Atari 2600 (No-Intro)",
  "system_settings": false,          // whether the profile has settings for this system
  "summary": { "groups": 601, "winners": 602, "alternatives": 270, "exclusions": 0, "unresolved": 2 },
  "coverage_drift": {                // where the clone list and metadata no longer match the DAT
    "clone_list": true, "metadata": true,
    "unmatched_clone_list_terms": ["…"], "titles_without_metadata": ["…"]
  },
  "groups": [
    {
      "group": "parachute",
      "unresolved": true,            // decided by a tie-breaker: the winner is provisional
      "winners": [
        { "title": "…", "unresolved": true,
          "rule": { "stage": "Parent selection", "ref": "REF0059", "message": "…" } }
      ],
      "alternatives": [
        { "title": "…", "clone_of": "…", "rule": { "stage": "…", "ref": "…", "message": "…" } }
      ],
      "exclusions": [ { "title": "…", "reason": "Demos, kiosks, and samples", "rule": { "…": "…" } } ]
    }
  ]
}
```

- Each winner, alternative and exclusion carries the rule that decided it: the stage, the engine's trace reference and
  its message. `ref` is absent when no trace record names the release, for example a release filtered out by region.
- A group is `unresolved` when its deciding rule is the engine's fail-safe (choosing the highest string) or a
  compilation tie-breaker. The engine's pick stays as the provisional winner: review it. Confirming it, or choosing
  other releases, resolves it.
- A group with your choice carries `choice`: the releases you checked, its `status` (`applied`, `matches_default`,
  `conflicting` or `stale`), the engine's `picks` and whether the engine left it unresolved. Releases it moved carry
  a rule whose stage is `choice`. The selection's `stale_choices` lists your choices for groups that are gone.
- A group has `drift` when a release in it has no metadata, or the clone list names it but no longer matches the DAT.

## Store

The store is one directory: a SQLite database (`title-select.sqlite`), the unmodified DAT files under `dats/<sha256>`,
`backups/`, and `tmp/`, where selections and previews run. Pass it with `--store <dir>` or `TITLE_SELECT_STORE`; it is created on
first use. Only one Title Select process may have a store open at a time: it holds an exclusive lock on
`<store>/lock`, and another process fails at once with "the store is in use by another Title Select process".

- The database runs in WAL mode. Every connection uses `synchronous=FULL`, `foreign_keys=ON` and a busy timeout.
- A DAT file is written to a temp file, fsynced and renamed into place before its row is inserted. Files under
  `dats/` that no DAT revision holds are deleted each time the store opens.
- Migrations are embedded and forward-only. Before one runs on a store that already has a schema, the database is
  copied with `VACUUM INTO` to `backups/schema-<version>-<time>.sqlite`. A store from a newer Title Select is refused.
- A DAT revision's file is kept while a retained or running audit refers to it or while it is the newest imported
  revision of its DAT. Otherwise the file is deleted after the next import or audit; the DAT revision's row stays, so
  history still names it. Importing the same file again restores it and keeps it until an audit using it finishes or a
  newer revision of its DAT is imported.

## Configuration

`title-select.toml`, passed with `--config <file>` or `TITLE_SELECT_CONFIG`, declares the roots Title Select may
read. Without it there are no roots, so Title Select reads none of your folders.

```toml
[roots.sets]                # a root called `sets`
path = "/data/source-sets"
writable = false            # the default; every root is read-only until change plans exist

[audits]
keep = 20                   # full audits kept per source set (the default)

[selections]
keep = 20                   # full selections kept per source set (the default)

[auth]                      # how the Service knows it is you; see "Service"
identity_header = "Remote-User"
trusted_proxies = ["10.0.0.0/8"]
# dev_identity = "Developer"

[jobs]
concurrent = 1              # jobs run at once (the default)
pace = "default"            # gentle | default | unthrottled
# readers = 2               # overrides the pace's payload readers
# hashers = 2               # overrides the pace's hash workers
```

## Commands

```sh
title-select dat import <DAT file> --provider <name> [--source-url <url>]
```

Imports an unmodified DAT file as a DAT revision, recording its SHA-256, header `name` and `version`, original
filename, import time, provider and source URL. A DAT is identified by its provider and header name, written
`<provider>/<name>`; each import of new bytes adds a DAT revision of it. Importing the same bytes again changes
nothing and prints the existing DAT revision, restoring its file if the store had dropped it.

```sh
title-select set add <root> <relative path> --dat <provider>/<name>
title-select set list
title-select set history <source set>
```

`set add` registers a folder in a root, such as `sets "No-Intro/Atari - 2600"`, as a source set bound to an imported
DAT. The source set is named by its folder (`Atari - 2600`). An absolute path, `..`, or a symlink that resolves
outside the root is refused. `set list` prints each source set with the DAT revision it was last verified against:
its latest audit's, the latest being the last to finish. `set history` lists a source set's audits, latest first, with
the time, DAT revision, counts, and whether the full audit is kept or only its summary.

```sh
title-select audit --set <source set> [--revision <sha256 prefix>] [--output <report file>]
```

Audits a registered source set, read-only, and records it. Unlike the stateless audit, it does not follow a symlink
that resolves outside the root: such a file or folder is an unreadable entry with that reason. Without `--revision`,
the DAT revision is the latest audit's, else the newest imported revision of the bound DAT, so a newer DAT revision is
adopted only when you name it. The entries and game statuses are written in one transaction when the audit finishes,
and the report below is generated from them. Afterwards, audits beyond the newest `audits.keep` are pruned to a
one-row summary; the latest audit, and any audit cited as provenance, are never pruned.

## Service

```sh
title-select serve [--listen <address:port>] [--ui <dir>] [--retool <dir>]
```

Runs the Service: the `/api/v1` JSON API, and the jobs that run audits and selections. It listens on `--listen` or
`TITLE_SELECT_LISTEN`, by default `127.0.0.1:8080`, and holds the store, and its lock, until it stops on SIGTERM or
Ctrl-C. While it runs, the store commands above fail with "the store is in use"; use the API, or the headless audit
below, instead. This is the supported way to run Title Select on your server. With `--ui` or `TITLE_SELECT_UI` naming
the workbench's built bundle, it also serves the workbench at `/`; see "Workbench". Selections and previews use the
selection engine install named by `--retool` or `TITLE_SELECT_RETOOL`, else `/opt/retool`, as for `select`. Without
one the Service still starts and runs audits, and refuses selections and previews, saying why.

### Auth

Every API path but `/api/v1/health` needs you to authenticate. The Service refuses to start without a way to
authenticate you:

- `[auth] identity_header` with `[auth] trusted_proxies`: your authenticating reverse proxy sets the header to your
  identity. The header is trusted only from a peer inside one of the CIDRs, and a request carrying it from any other
  peer is rejected. The identity is recorded as the actor of each job the request starts.
- The operator token: a file named by `TITLE_SELECT_OPERATOR_TOKEN_FILE` (or `--token-file`) holds a secret, sent as
  `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. The Service keeps only its SHA-256 and compares in constant time. Jobs it starts
  record the actor `Operator token`.
- `[auth] dev_identity`, for local development: a request with no credential is you, under that identity. The
  Service refuses to start with it unless it listens on a loopback address.

Any other request, or a wrong token, gets `401`.

### Jobs

An audit started through the API is a job: `queued`, `running`, then `succeeded` or `failed`. Each change of state is
one transaction, and a job runs to the end whether or not its client stays connected. The DAT revision is chosen when
the job is queued, as for `audit --set`, and its file is kept until the job ends. A source set has at most one queued
or running job; starting another is refused with `409`, naming the job.

A job found running when the Service starts was cut off by a stop: its unfinished audit is discarded, the job becomes
`interrupted`, and a fresh job (attempt 2) is queued for it. If that job is cut off too, it becomes `failed`.

`[jobs] concurrent` jobs run at once, 1 by default. Each audit reads payloads on `readers` threads, which also
decompress ZIP members, and checksums them on `hashers` threads. The pace sets both:

| `pace`        | readers | hashers | for                                                          |
|---------------|---------|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `gentle`      | 1       | 1       | one file at a time, leaving disks and CPUs to other services |
| `default`     | 2       | 2       | the default: overlaps one file's reading with another's hash |
| `unthrottled` | CPUs    | CPUs    | one of each per CPU, for an otherwise idle server            |

`[jobs] readers` or `hashers` overrides the pace's count. A job records the counts it was queued with.

A selection is a job too, of kind `selection`. It runs one version of a selection profile against the source set's
DAT revision, chosen as for an audit, and records the selection in the transaction that ends the job. A source set
may have one audit job and one selection job queued or running at once. Afterwards, selections beyond the newest
`selections.keep` are pruned to their summary; the latest is never pruned.

### Selection profiles

A selection profile is named, and every save is a new version, numbered from 1, that is never changed or deleted.
A version is stored as canonical JSON with its SHA-256, so saving a profile with nothing changed creates no version.
A save names the version it started from, and is refused with `409` if a newer version was saved since. A save may
queue a selection for one or more source sets with the new version.

### API

Every body is JSON, and every error is `{"error": "...", "job": <id, when one is named>}`.

| `GET /api/v1/jobs/{id}`                            | one job                                                      |

| `GET /api/v1/events`                               | server-sent events for every job, opening with a `resync`    |

A paged list is `{"items": [...], "next_cursor": "..."}`; pass `next_cursor` back as `?cursor=` for the next page, and
`?limit=` (1 to 1000, default 100) for its size. Each item carries its `seq`, its position in the report. A DAT upload
may be up to 512 MiB, and is `201` when it adds a DAT revision, `200` when the bytes were already imported.

Server-sent events carry JSON data, under one of these event names:

| Event      | Data                                   | Sent                                                         |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `state`    | the job                                | when a job's state changes; first on a job's own stream      |
| `progress` | `{"job", "files_done", "files_total"}` | while a job is running, at most five times a second          |
| `resync`   | `{"jobs": [...]}`, newest first        | by `/events` on connecting, and after the client fell behind |

A `resync` lists every queued or running job and the 50 most recently finished; it replaces what the client knew,
since events in between may have been dropped. An idle stream sends a comment every 15 seconds.

Every job carries a `version` that goes up with each change of its state, and `progress` carries the `version` of the
running job it belongs to. The Service drops events that a `resync` or a later `state` already superseded, and a
client should do the same: ignore a `state` whose `version` is at or below the one it holds for that job, and
`progress` whose `version` is below it.

### Headless audit

```sh
title-select audit --server <url> --set <source set> [--revision <sha256 prefix>] [--output <report file>]
```

Starts an audit job on the Service at `<url>`, sending your operator token from `TITLE_SELECT_OPERATOR_TOKEN_FILE` (or
`--token-file`), and follows it to the end. Progress and a summary of the findings and game statuses go to stderr; the
report goes to stdout, or to `--output`. If the job's event stream sends nothing, not even its keep-alive, for 45
seconds, the client polls the job's state instead. Exits 0 when the audit completes, and non-zero when the job fails,
the token is refused or the Service cannot be reached.

### Image

`ghcr.io/jbruns/title-select` is a static binary, the workbench's bundle (at `/ui`) and the patched selection engine
with its pinned clone lists and venv (at `/opt/retool`) on `gcr.io/distroless/python3-debian12:nonroot`, for
linux/amd64. The licence texts the About page shows are at `/ui/licences`: Title Select's, the selection engine's and
the clone lists and metadata's. It runs `serve` on `0.0.0.0:8080` as the nonroot user, with the store at the volume
`/store`, and serves the workbench at `/`. It needs nothing else writable, so you can run it with a read-only root
filesystem:

```sh
docker run --read-only -p 8080:8080 -v title-select-store:/store \
  -v /path/to/token:/run/operator-token:ro -e TITLE_SELECT_OPERATOR_TOKEN_FILE=/run/operator-token \
  -v /path/to/title-select.toml:/etc/title-select.toml:ro -e TITLE_SELECT_CONFIG=/etc/title-select.toml \
  -v /data/source-sets:/data/source-sets:ro ghcr.io/jbruns/title-select:sha-<commit>
```

CI publishes `sha-<commit>` (the full commit SHA) for each push to `main`, and `<version>` and `<major>.<minor>` for
each `v<version>` tag.

### Health

```sh
title-select health [--url <url>] [--timeout <seconds>]
```

Checks a running Service, for a container healthcheck in an image with no shell or curl. `--url` defaults to
`http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/v1/health` and `--timeout` to 5 seconds (1 to 300). It follows no redirect and ignores
proxy settings. Exits 0, printing nothing, when the Service answers 200 with `{"status": "ok"}`; otherwise exits 1
with one line on stderr saying why: the Service cannot be reached, did not answer in time, answered another status, or
answered another body. In Compose:

```yaml
healthcheck: { test: ["CMD", "/title-select", "health"] }
```

## Workbench

The workbench is your browser interface to the Service: a Leptos app compiled to WebAssembly that uses only the
`/api/v1` JSON API, from the same origin. Its screens:

- **Source sets** lists each source set with its latest audit and the DAT revision it was last verified against, and
  registers another from a root, a path in it and a DAT. Opening a source set shows its facts, starts an audit against
  the default DAT revision or a newer one, makes a selection with a selection profile, lists its selections, and
  lists its audit history, latest first, with a Re-audit for each row.
- **DAT revisions** lists every DAT revision, newest import first within each DAT, with its provenance (provider,
  source URL, file, SHA-256, import time), whether its file is kept, and the audits that refer to it. It uploads a DAT
  file as a new DAT revision.
- **Audit** shows the audit's source set, DAT revision and times, exports its JSON report and re-audits. Its summary
  counts each finding and game status, and two derived states: an entry is verified when it is matched with payload
  evidence, and needs review when it is misnamed, conflicting, mismatched, unmatched or unreadable. Its entries load in
  one request from the bulk NDJSON endpoint, then filter by name, finding, state, game status and evidence algorithm,
  and sort by any column, in the browser as each key is typed. Selecting an entry shows its evidence and the ROMs it
  matches. A pruned audit shows only its summary.
- **Selection profiles** lists your selection profiles. A new one starts as an unsaved draft with the defaults:
  preview what it selects, change anything, and confirm to save version 1. The editor has a global settings tab and
  a tab per system; each system setting says whether it comes from your global settings or is set for that system,
  with "Use global setting" to go back. "Reset to defaults" and "Reset to default choices" work per group, per system
  and for the whole profile. The preview follows your edits 500 ms after you stop, cancelling a preview still
  running; when a preview of a source set takes more than 2 seconds, it waits for the Preview button instead. It
  shows what changed from the latest saved selection. Saving creates the next version and can make a selection.
- **Selection** explains every group: each release's role, the rule that decided it, its availability in the latest
  audit against the same DAT revision, and flags for unresolved, stale, conflicting and drift. Its releases filter by
  name, role, availability and flag as you type. Opening a group lets you check the releases you want, confirm an
  unresolved pick, include an excluded release, or reset the group to the default choices; your choices are staged
  until you save them as the next version of the profile, which makes a new selection.
- **Jobs** lists the latest jobs with their kind, state, progress and result, live: it follows `/api/v1/events`, applies `state`
  and `progress` events by the job `version` rule above, and replaces what it holds with each `resync` snapshot,
  which also arrives after a reconnect.
- **About**, linked from every screen's footer, says where selection comes from and shows the licence texts of Title
  Select, the selection engine and its clone lists and metadata, served from the bundle's `licences/` folder.

Every table is virtualized, sorts by its column headers and works from the keyboard: Tab to the table, then the arrow
keys, Page Up, Page Down, Home and End move the selected row, Enter opens it and Escape clears it. Each screen's
controls are ordinary buttons, links and form fields. The workbench needs an evergreen browser; it makes no request
to any other origin and keeps no credential in browser storage. Its fonts, Liberation Sans and Liberation Mono, are
served with it under the SIL Open Font License (`crates/ui/assets/fonts/LICENSE-OFL.txt`).

The workbench's own files are served without auth, with a same-origin Content Security Policy; everything it shows
comes from the API, which needs you to authenticate as above. Behind an authenticating reverse proxy, the proxy's
identity header covers the browser's API requests. To run it locally, with `[auth] dev_identity` on a loopback address:

```sh
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown   # rust-toolchain.toml lists it
cargo install cargo-leptos --locked
cargo leptos build --release               # the workbench into target/site, and the binary
tools/retool/setup                         # the selection engine, with the licences the About page shows
mkdir -p target/site/licences && cp LICENSE target/site/licences/title-select.txt \
  && cp .retool/retool/LICENSE target/site/licences/retool.txt \
  && cp .retool/retool/clonelists-LICENSE target/site/licences/retool-clonelists-metadata.txt
printf '[roots.sets]\npath = "/data/source-sets"\n\n[auth]\ndev_identity = "Developer"\n' > dev.toml
target/release/title-select --store dev-store --config dev.toml serve --ui target/site --retool .retool
```

Then open `http://127.0.0.1:8080/`.

`crates/ui/bench/filter.py` measures the audit screen's filtering over 100,000 synthetic entries in headless Chromium.
It builds the workbench with the `bench` feature, which adds a `/bench` screen of synthetic entries that no release or
image has, serves it on a loopback port with a scratch store under `target/bench`, and reports p50 and p95. It needs
Playwright for Python; from the repository's root:

```sh
python3 -m venv .venv && .venv/bin/pip install playwright && .venv/bin/playwright install chromium
.venv/bin/python crates/ui/bench/filter.py
```

## Development

Decisions are recorded in [docs/adr/](docs/adr/). A Cargo workspace: `crates/api` (the API's and the report's types), `crates/engine` (the Audit), `crates/store`
(the store and configuration), `crates/server` (the Service), `crates/cli` (the `title-select` binary) and
`crates/ui` (the workbench). The workbench's filtering, sorting, derived states and Job event handling are plain Rust,
tested on the host with `cargo test`; `cargo clippy --package title-select-ui --target wasm32-unknown-unknown` checks
it as the browser runs it. `crates/selection` runs Retool and derives the Selection from its trace.

### Retool

`third_party/retool/` holds Retool for Selection (ADR 0001):

- `upstream/`: the pristine Retool tree at a pinned commit, without its GUI, never edited in place. Its `tests/`
  fixtures seed the conformance tests.
- `patches/`: applied in order at build time. `0001-no-network` turns every download into an error, so a missing
  clone-list or metadata folder or config file fails instead of being fetched; `0002-run-paths` adds
  `--clonelist-dir`, `--metadata-dir`, `--mia-dir`, `--ra-dir` and `--system-config-dir`; `0003-trace-json` adds
  `--trace-json <path>`; `0004-system-settings` makes a system's `override exclusions` clear the aftermarket exclusion
  and its `override options` clear and accept `l` and `n`, which the parser missed.
- `pins.toml`: the Retool commit and the sha256 of its tree, each patch's sha256, and the clone-list and metadata
  commit with the sha256 of its archive. `tools/retool/build.py` checks every one before it builds.
- `requirements.in` and the hash-locked `requirements.txt`: Retool's runtime dependencies, without its GUI's.

`tools/retool/setup [dir]` builds `.retool/` (gitignored), which the Selection tests use through
`TITLE_SELECT_RETOOL` (cargo sets it): the patched Retool with the pinned clone lists, the pristine Retool for the
patch-neutrality test, and a Python 3.11 venv made with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/). Run it after changing a pin
or a patch; the tests fail, rather than skip, without it.

- **Clone-list pin:** Renovate proposes upstream's newest `main` commit in `pins.toml`, and the `clone-list pin`
  workflow writes the new archive's sha256 on its branch and runs CI. It runs the default branch's `build.py`, never
  the branch's code, because it holds a write token. By hand: change `commit`, run
  `python3 tools/retool/build.py pin-clone-lists`, then `tools/retool/setup` and the tests.
- **Retool pin:** frozen; it changes only by hand. Vendor the new tree into `upstream/`, rework the patches, and copy
  the hashes `python3 tools/retool/build.py hash-tree` prints into `pins.toml`.
- **Goldens:** `crates/selection/tests/goldens/` holds each conformance case's Selection and trace (its records that
  don't depend on set order). After a deliberate change to a patch, a pin or the derivation, regenerate them with
  `TITLE_SELECT_REGENERATE_GOLDENS=1 cargo test -p title-select-selection --test conformance` and review the diff.
- **A real DAT:** `TITLE_SELECT_ATARI_DAT=<DAT file> cargo test -p title-select-selection --test selection --
  --ignored --nocapture` selects from it, checks every group has a rule and prints the counts. Never commit the DAT.

## Licence

MIT. See [LICENSE](LICENSE). The vendored Retool is BSD-3-Clause
([third_party/retool/upstream/LICENSE](third_party/retool/upstream/LICENSE)); the image ships the clone lists and
metadata with their BSD-3-Clause licence beside them. The image also ships all three licence texts under
`/ui/licences`, where the workbench's About page shows them.
